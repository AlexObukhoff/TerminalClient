The IDTechSDK requires libusb to communicate with the devices. Please download libusb (libusb.org) for your platform. A Google search will provide the necessary information.

Alternately, the provided libusb-1.0.so can be placed in the /lib folder to provide functionality, but a proper install of libusb is recommended.

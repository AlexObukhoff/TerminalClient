/*
 *    idea.c - C source code for IDEA block cipher.
 *      IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm), formerly known as
 *      IPES (Improved Proposed Encryption Standard).
 *      Algorithm developed by Xuejia Lai and James L. Massey, of ETH Zurich.
 *      This implementation modified and derived from original C code
 *      developed by Xuejia Lai.
 *      Zero-based indexing added, names changed from IPES to IDEA.
 *      CFB functions added.  Random number routines added.
 *
 *      Extensively optimized and restructured by Colin Plumb.
 *
 *      There are two adjustments that can be made to this code to
 *      speed it up.  Defaults may be used for PCs.  Only the -DIDEA32
 *      pays off significantly if selectively set or not set.
 *      Experiment to see what works best for your machine.
 *
 *      Multiplication: default is inline, -DAVOID_JUMPS uses a
 *              different version that does not do any conditional
 *              jumps (a few percent worse on a SPARC), while
 *              -DSMALL_CACHE takes it out of line to stay
 *              within a small on-chip code cache.
 *      Variables: normally, 16-bit variables are used, but some
 *              machines (notably RISCs) do not have 16-bit registers,
 *              so they do a great deal of masking.  -DIDEA32 uses "int"
 *              register variables and masks explicitly only where
 *              necessary.  On a SPARC, for example, this boosts
 *              performace by 30%.
 *
 *      The IDEA(tm) block cipher is covered by patents held by ETH and a
 *      Swiss company called Ascom-Tech AG.  The Swiss patent number is
 *      PCT/CH91/00117, the European patent number is EP 0 482 154 B1, and
 *      the U.S. patent number is US005214703.  IDEA(tm) is a trademark of
 *      Ascom-Tech AG.  There is no license fee required for noncommercial
 *      use.  Commercial users may obtain licensing details from Dieter
 *      Profos, Ascom Tech AG, Solothurn Lab, Postfach 151, 4502 Solothurn,
 *      Switzerland, Tel +41 65 242885, Fax +41 65 235761.
 *
 *      The IDEA block cipher uses a 64-bit block size, and a 128-bit key
 *      size.  It breaks the 64-bit cipher block into four 16-bit words
 *      because all of the primitive inner operations are done with 16-bit
 *      arithmetic.  It likewise breaks the 128-bit cipher key into eight
 *      16-bit words.
 *
 *      For further information on the IDEA cipher, see the book:
 *        Xuejia Lai, "On the Design and Security of Block Ciphers",
 *        ETH Series on Information Processing (ed. J.L. Massey) Vol 1,
 *        Hartung-Gorre Verlag, Konstanz, Switzerland, 1992.  ISBN
 *        3-89191-573-X.
 *
 *      This code runs on arrays of bytes by taking pairs in big-endian
 *      order to make the 16-bit words that IDEA uses internally.  This
 *      produces the same result regardless of the byte order of the
 *      native CPU.

/*
 * Okay, explanation time:
 * Phil invented a unique way of doing CFB that's sensitive to semantic
 * boundaries within the data being encrypted.  One way to phrase
 * CFB en/decryption is to say that you XOR the current 8 bytes with
 * IDEA(previous 8 bytes of ciphertext).  Normally, you repeat this
 * at 8-byte intervals, but Phil decided to resync things on the
 * boundaries between elements in the stream being encrypted.
 *
 * That is, the last 4 bytes of a 12-byte field are en/decrypted using
 * the first 4 bytes of IDEA(previous 8 bytes of ciphertext), but then
 * the last 4 bytes of that IDEA computation are thrown away, and the
 * first 8 bytes of the next field are en/decrypted using
 * IDEA(last 8 bytes of ciphertext).  This is equivalent to using a
 * shorter feedback length (if you're familiar with the general CFB
 * technique) briefly, and doesn't weaken the cipher any (using shorter
 * CFB lengths makes it stronger, actually), it just makes it a bit unusual.
 *
 * Anyway, to accomodate this behaviour, every time we do an IDEA
 * encrpytion of 8 bytes of ciphertext to get 8 bytes of XOR mask,
 * we remember the ciphertext.  Then if we have to resync things
 * after having processed, say, 2 bytes, we refill the iv buffer
 * with the last 6 bytes of the old ciphertext followed by the
 * 2 bytes of new ciphertext stored in the front of the iv buffer.
